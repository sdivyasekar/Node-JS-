Callbacks are nothing but functions that take some time to produce a result.
Usually these async callbacks (async short for asynchronous) are used for accessing values from databases, downloading images, reading files etc.
As these take time to finish, we can neither proceed to next line because it might throw an error saying unavailable nor we can pause our program.
So we need to store the result and call back when it is complete.
